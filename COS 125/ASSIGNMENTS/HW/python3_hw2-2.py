# A Mad Lib is a word game in which a player is asked for individual words of a specific type. The user blindly
# enters the words. Once the words are entered, they are used to complete a small piece of text. For this
# assignment, you will write a short Mad Lib. You can create your own text or use the example below. Your Mad
# Lib should ask the player for at least five words. There is no min or max on the size of the text (obviously, it
# will be greater than or equal to five words).
